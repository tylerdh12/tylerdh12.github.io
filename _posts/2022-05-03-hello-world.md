# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog. I have been a developer for about 13 years at this point. I have not previously had a blog before, but I am excited to start sharing my experiences with others and help others learn from my experiences.

My primary stack is the PERN stack, which is a combination of the following:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

I am about to start a new journey at a new company. I am excited to see what skills I will be adding to my experiences. With this company I will be using Python and some DotNet Core as well as my current stack.
